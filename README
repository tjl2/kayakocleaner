INTRODUCTION
============
Save the laborious task of clearing out the ticket system each day.

INSTALLATION
============
Install the mechanize gem.

Run the kayakocleaner.rb script and provide your Kayako admin URL, your username and password as args:

  ruby kayakocleaner.rb http://support/admin user p455w0rd

CONFIGURATION
=============
To handle which tickets are cleared, add a new Ticket to the @tickets_to_clear array:

  Ticket.new("a description", "search term that finds these ticket types", :close)

You must make sure that the search term ONLY finds the specific tickets you wish to close/delete, otherwise
you will end up closing/deleting the wrong tickets. If in doubt, set the disposal type to :close, not
:delete!

The description is just used in the command output, so use whatever identifies these tickets to you.
The disposal method (last argument to the Ticket object) can be :close, or :delete.

This only works with Kayako version 2.
